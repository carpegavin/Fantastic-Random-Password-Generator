# Random-Password-Generator
## https://carpegavin.github.io/Random-Password-Generator/

## The goal of this project was to create a random password generator to meet certain criteria in order to protect an employee's sensitive data.

## The acceptance criteria are as follows:
1. When the user clicks the generate password button, they are prompted to enter several differnet variables to create said password, to include:
  * length -- between 8 and 128 characters
  * lowercase characters
  * uppercase
  * special symbols
  
2. When the user clicks OK, at least one character type should be selected

3. When the user responded to all the prompts, a password is generated within set parameters and displayed on the screen.

## To accomplish this goal I did the following:
 1. set my query selectors and eventlistener
 2. set my five variables for length, lowercase, uppercase, numbers, symbols
  * At first I attempted charCode but ended up pulling out of split arrays
 2.5 set my confirm and alert messages
 3. sey my assignments and operators
 4. set my "if" logic
 5. set my "for" loops
 6. pushed my variables to the "for: loops
 7. floored and randomized passwordLength
 8. cleaned the code -- removed the dead comments; removed the many console logs; checked for grammar issues.
